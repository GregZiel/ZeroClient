Now that we've clarified our approach for working with Bolt.new, I recommend the following next steps:

1. **Finalize the Consolidated Technical Specification**
   - Address the inconsistencies we identified in our documentation review
   - Create a single, authoritative reference document for the ultra-rapid MVP
   - Ensure it clearly defines authentication approach, offline capabilities, widget implementation, and deployment targets

2. **Create a Master Prompt for Bolt.new**
   - Develop a comprehensive initial prompt that captures all essential requirements
   - Structure it to encourage modular development even within Bolt's holistic approach
   - Include explicit instructions about preserving code between iterations
   - Reference our specific technical requirements and constraints

3. **Develop an Evaluation Prompt Template**
   - Create a template for evaluating generated code against our requirements
   - Include specific criteria for mobile optimization, offline capabilities, etc.
   - Design it to provide objective assessment without triggering regeneration

4. **Establish a Change Request Prompt Strategy**
   - Develop language patterns that encourage targeted modifications
   - Create templates for different types of changes (feature additions, bug fixes, optimizations)
   - Include explicit preservation instructions to minimize regeneration

5. **Plan the Initial Implementation Session**
   - Schedule a focused session for the initial Bolt.new implementation
   - Prepare all reference materials and requirements in advance
   - Establish a process for documenting the generated output and evaluation results

Would you like me to start with any of these specific tasks? For example, I could draft the master prompt for Bolt.new based on our consolidated requirements, or create the evaluation prompt template.
