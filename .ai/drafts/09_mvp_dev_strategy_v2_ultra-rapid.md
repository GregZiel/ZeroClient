# Ultra-Rapid ZeroClient Development Strategy

Given your specific context as a solo developer with AI assistance and a 3-4 day timeline, we need an extremely pragmatic approach.

## Recommended Strategy: "Accelerated MVP"

### Day 1: Foundation & Core UI
- **Morning**: Set up Astro + React project using official starter template
- **Afternoon**: Implement basic UI layout and navigation using Shadcn/UI
- **Evening**: Create authentication screens and user flow

### Day 2: Data Layer & Basic Monitoring
- **Morning**: Set up Supabase connection with basic authentication
- **Afternoon**: Implement device subscription mechanism and storage
- **Evening**: Create tabular data view component for real-time monitoring

### Day 3: Caching & Mobile Optimization
- **Morning**: Implement IndexedDB for basic caching
- **Afternoon**: Add manual cache controls and status indicators
- **Evening**: Optimize interface for mobile and test on actual devices

### Day 4: Widget & Deployment
- **Morning**: Create simple embeddable widget version
- **Afternoon**: Set up Docker deployment configuration for Mikrus
- **Evening**: Deploy first version and document basic usage

## Implementation Tactics

1. **Maximize AI Pairing**
   - Use AI for generating boilerplate code and component structures
   - Have AI review your code regularly and suggest optimizations
   - Keep AI context-aware by sharing your progress and challenges

2. **Simplify Architecture Initially**
   - Defer microfrontend implementation for later iterations
   - Use a monolithic approach for first version
   - Keep Module Federation on roadmap, but don't implement in initial version

3. **Leverage Existing Solutions**
   - Use Supabase Auth UI components instead of building custom auth
   - Adopt pre-built Shadcn components rather than custom UI
   - Use Astro's built-in features for static/dynamic rendering decisions

4. **Focus on Core User Flows**
   - Implement only what's needed for basic monitoring functionality
   - Create simplified widget with HTTP-only data fetching (defer MQTT)
   - Limit initial version to one backend connection type

5. **Prepare for Evolution**
   - Document architectural decisions for future reference
   - Create a clear roadmap for post-MVP improvements
   - Structure code to accommodate later refactoring

## Tools Specifically Helpful for Solo + AI Development

1. **GitHub Copilot**: Real-time code suggestions while you type
2. **Cursor.sh**: AI-powered code editor with contextual understanding
3. **Superbase UI Library**: Pre-built auth and database components
4. **Netlify/Vercel**: Quick deployments to test and share progress
5. **Docker Desktop**: Simplified container management for final deployment

With this approach, you can have a functional MVP deployed within your 3-4 day timeline, focused on core monitoring capabilities with basic caching. The architecture will be simpler than originally envisioned but can evolve toward the more sophisticated version as you iterate.
