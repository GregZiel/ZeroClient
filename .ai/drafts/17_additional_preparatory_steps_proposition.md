# Additional Preparatory Steps Before Implementation

Before proceeding to document corrections and actual implementation, there are several lightweight but valuable preparatory steps we can take to increase our chances of success with the AI development tools:

## 1. Create Prompt Templates and Libraries

**Value**: Standardized prompts improve consistency and reduce regeneration issues.

**Implementation**:
- Create a library of reusable prompt patterns for common tasks (component creation, feature addition, bug fixing)
- Develop templates with clear sections for requirements, constraints, and preservation instructions
- Include specific language patterns that have proven effective with AI tools

**Example Template**:
```
# Feature Implementation: [Feature Name]

## Context
[Description of where this fits in the application]

## Requirements
[Numbered list of specific requirements]

## Constraints
- Preserve existing functionality in [specific areas]
- Only modify files in [specific directories]
- Maintain [specific patterns/standards]

## Integration Points
[Description of how this connects to other components]

## Success Criteria
[Measurable outcomes to verify implementation]
```

## 2. Develop a Simple Evaluation Framework

**Value**: Objective measurement of AI output quality to guide corrections.

**Implementation**:
- Create simple scripts to check for required features/patterns in generated code
- Develop a scoring system for key requirements (mobile optimization, error handling, etc.)
- Prepare a checklist template for manual review of critical aspects

**Example Evaluation Criteria**:
1. Code Structure (0-5): Follows modular pattern, clear separation of concerns
2. Mobile Optimization (0-5): Touch targets, responsive layouts, performance
3. Error Handling (0-5): Comprehensive coverage, user-friendly messages
4. Offline Support (0-5): Caching implementation, synchronization
5. Security Implementation (0-5): Authentication, data protection, API security

## 3. Set Up a Rapid Prototyping Environment

**Value**: Quick validation of AI-generated components before full integration.

**Implementation**:
- Create a minimal sandbox environment for testing components in isolation
- Set up simple mock data generators for testing without backend dependencies
- Prepare a basic component library for reference and comparison

**Key Components**:
- Storybook or similar tool for isolated component testing
- Mock API service with realistic data responses
- Simple state management for testing stateful components

## 4. Create a Visual Reference Guide

**Value**: Clear visual targets help the AI generate more accurate UI components.

**Implementation**:
- Collect or create simple mockups of key UI components
- Document visual patterns for recurring elements (cards, tables, forms)
- Define clear visual hierarchy examples for complex screens

**Elements to Include**:
- Mobile and desktop layouts for key screens
- Component state variations (loading, error, empty, populated)
- Animation and transition references
- Visual hierarchy examples

## 5. Develop a Minimal Test Suite

**Value**: Automated validation of critical functionality to catch regressions.

**Implementation**:
- Create simple unit tests for core utilities and functions
- Develop basic integration tests for critical user flows
- Set up automated accessibility and mobile-friendliness checks

**Focus Areas**:
- Authentication flow
- Data fetching and display
- Offline functionality
- Form validation
- Navigation and routing

## 6. Create a "Rescue Kit" for Common AI Pitfalls

**Value**: Ready-made solutions for typical AI development challenges.

**Implementation**:
- Prepare snippets and patterns for commonly problematic areas
- Document fallback implementations for complex features
- Create recovery strategies for typical AI mistakes

**Common Pitfalls to Address**:
- Authentication edge cases
- Complex state management
- Offline/online synchronization
- Mobile-specific optimizations
- Performance optimizations for large datasets

## 7. Establish a Quick Feedback Loop Mechanism

**Value**: Rapid iteration and correction without full regeneration.

**Implementation**:
- Set up a structured feedback format that encourages targeted changes
- Create a system for tracking which feedback was implemented
- Develop a process for verifying fixes without triggering cascading changes

**Feedback Format Example**:
```
## Component: [Component Name]

### Issue 1: [Brief Description]
- Location: [File path and line numbers]
- Current behavior: [What's happening now]
- Expected behavior: [What should happen]
- Suggested approach: [Specific guidance without rewriting everything]

### Issue 2: [Brief Description]
...
```

## 8. Create a Feature Flag System Design

**Value**: Safely integrate potentially problematic features without breaking the application.

**Implementation**:
- Design a simple feature flag system for the AI to implement
- Prepare configuration for enabling/disabling features
- Document strategy for gradual feature rollout

**Key Elements**:
- Feature flag configuration structure
- Implementation pattern for conditional rendering
- Strategy for handling disabled feature paths

## 9. Develop a Component API Documentation Template

**Value**: Clear interface definitions reduce integration issues between components.

**Implementation**:
- Create templates for documenting component props, events, and behaviors
- Prepare examples of well-documented components for the AI to follow
- Develop standards for component API design

**Documentation Template Example**:
```
# Component: [Component Name]

## Purpose
[Brief description of component purpose]

## Props
| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| prop1 | string | '' | Description of prop1 |
| prop2 | boolean | false | Description of prop2 |

## Events
| Name | Parameters | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| onChange | (value: string) | Triggered when value changes |

## Usage Example
```jsx
<ComponentName prop1="value" prop2={true} onChange={handleChange} />
```
```

These preparatory steps are lightweight but can significantly improve our success with AI development tools. They provide structure, guidance, and safety nets that will help us maintain control over the development process while leveraging the speed and capabilities of AI-powered development.
