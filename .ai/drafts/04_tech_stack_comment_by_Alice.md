# ZeroClient Tech Stack Analysis

Based on my review of the provided documents, the proposed tech stack is **largely feasible** for the ZeroClient MVP, with some considerations and recommendations.

## Strengths

- **Astro + React combination** is excellent for minimizing JavaScript while maintaining interactivity where needed
- **Supabase backend** provides built-in auth, database and API layers without excessive complexity
- **Cache-first approach** with IndexedDB aligns perfectly with offline requirements
- **Microfrontend architecture** supports the widget embedding requirement and future extensibility

## Potential Challenges

1. **Resource constraints** on Mikrus 1.0 Pro (1 vCPU, 640MB RAM)
   - PostgreSQL + Node.js + Docker might push these limits
   - Recommend load testing early in development

2. **Microfrontend implementation with Astro**
   - Module Federation integration with Astro needs verification
   - Consider Astro's Islands architecture as alternative approach

3. **Mobile optimization details**
   - Ensure Shadcn components support one-handed operation
   - Test on actual mobile devices in poor connectivity conditions

4. **Cache management specifics**
   - Need clearer structure for storing/prioritizing different data types
   - Define synchronization protocols for reconnection scenarios

## Recommendations

1. **Start with simplified architecture**
   - Begin with monolithic proof-of-concept before implementing microfrontends
   - Establish core data flow and caching before splitting into modules

2. **Benchmark early**
   - Test performance on Mikrus-equivalent environment
   - Measure memory usage, especially with PostgreSQL + Node.js

3. **Validate offline capabilities**
   - Create sandbox test for IndexedDB capacity on mobile devices
   - Test synchronization after extended offline periods

4. **Consider progressive enhancement**
   - Implement basic functionality without JavaScript first
   - Layer interactive features for better experience in good connectivity

The stack is well-aligned with requirements, particularly for cache-first operation and mobile optimization. With careful implementation and early testing of the identified challenge areas, it should successfully meet the MVP goals.
