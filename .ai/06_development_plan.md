  - Add error handling for authentication flows
  - Deploy updated version with functional auth

## Day 3: Data Layer & Visualization
- **Morning**:
  - Implement backend connection testing functionality
  - Create data polling infrastructure
  - Set up connection status indicators
  
- **Afternoon**:

## Key Deliverables by Day

### Day 1
- Functional placeholder site with design system
- GitHub repository with basic workflow
- Initial deployment to DigitalOcean
- Comprehensive wireframes and design specifications

### Day 2
- Functional authentication system
- User management capabilities
- Backend connection configuration screen
- Full CI/CD pipeline with testing

### Day 3
- Live data visualization from backends
- Data polling with configurable refresh
- Connection status monitoring
- Error handling for data operations

### Day 4
