# UI Architecture for ZeroClient MVP

## 1. UI Structure Overview

The ZeroClient MVP UI is designed with a mobile-first approach, optimized for one-handed operation while providing comprehensive industrial monitoring capabilities. The architecture follows a hierarchical structure with a bottom navigation bar on mobile and side navigation on desktop, organizing content into logical sections based on user needs.

The interface prioritizes clear status indicators, efficient data presentation, and offline functionality, with special attention to usability in challenging field conditions. The design leverages Shadcn/UI components extended with custom elements specific to industrial monitoring needs.
